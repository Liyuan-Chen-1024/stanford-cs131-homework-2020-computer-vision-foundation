# Object removal is implemented by first creating a binary mask during preprocessing of the object to be removed. First, the masked region's area is measured so it can decided whether it is more efficient to remove the object by removing top to bottom seams or left to right seams. Then, when generating the image's energy map, areas under the masked region are weighted with a very high negative value. This guarantees that the minimum seam will be routed through the masked region. Minimum seam removal is then performed as usual. The only difference is that when removing the minimum seam from an image, the same minimum seam must also be removed from the mask so that the next step's energy calculation is accurate. After the masked region has been completely removed, seam insertion is used to return the image back to it's original dimensions. Forward energy is used during the seam removal but not during the seam insertion.


    assert image.shape[:2] == mask.shape

    H, W, _ = image.shape
    out = np.copy(image)
